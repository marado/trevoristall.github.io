## About Me

Hello! My name is Trevor Allen and I live in Asheville, North Carolina. By day, I work for [The Wired Mouse](https://www.thewiredmouse.com) as a web designer. In my spare time, I do freelance web and graphic design, dance contra, draw, watch movies (Guardians of the Galaxy was awesome!) drink coffee, eat coconut ice cream, and explore Asheville.
I specialize in creating websites that are user-friendly and built according to best-practice web standards. I also create corporate identity, branding, and other things. Over the past years, I've enjoyed working with many clients that were pleased with my work.



#### ABOUT THIS WEBSITE

While working on websites, you'll usually see me drinking coffee or munching on something tasty.
This website was built using HTML5, SCSS with Compass and some jQuery. I initially thought of using Angularjs, but I decided to use Jekyll so I could attach a blog more easily.
